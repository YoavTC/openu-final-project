# ðŸŽ“University Final Project

This is a game I made for my Open University (Hasifa)'s Game Development course's final project. You can check out the game I made with a team in the prior semester, [[REDACTED]](https://github.com/YoavTC/openu-group-project).

It was made in the span of 3 months (Sep-Nov), done entirely by me. The game was made using Unity 2022.3.43f1.

The game is a simple take on the Tower Defence genre. You use your towers that are emoji to fight off waves of incoming enemies that are food emoji. There are multiple tower and enemy types, and the game encourages to experiment and find combos and unique placing strategies.
